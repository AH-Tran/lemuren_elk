This study focuses on the adaptation to and compensation for a force profile presented to one stationary arm which is proportional to the velocity of the other moving arm. We hypothesised that subjects would exhibit predictive coordinative responses which would co-vary with the state of the moving arm. Our null hypothesis is that they develop a time-dependent template of forces appropriate to compensate for the imposed perturbation. Subjects were trained to make 500 ms duration reaching movements with their dominant right arm to a visual target. A force generated with a robotic arm that was proportional to the velocity of the moving arm and perpendicular to movement direction acted on their stationary left hand, either at the same time as the movement or delayed by 250 or 500 ms. Subjects rapidly learnt to minimise the final end-point error. In the delay conditions, the left hand moved in advance of the onset of the perturbing force. In test conditions with faster or slower movement of the right hand, the predictive actions of the left hand co-varied with movement speed. Compensation for movement-related forces appeared to be predictive but not based on an accurate force profile that was equal and opposite to the imposed perturbation."], "AUTHOR": ["Jackson, Carl P T", "Miall, R Chris"], "SOURCE": ["Experimental brain research"], "VOLUME": ["184"], "ISSUE": ["2"], "PAGES": ["261-7"], "LANGUAGE": ["eng"], "PUBLDATE": ["2008-01"], "PUBLYEAR": ["2008"], "PUBLCOUNTRY": ["Germany"], "IDENTIFIER": ["(dnlm_pmc)3032228"], "DOI": ["10.1007/s00221-007-1179-6"], "EISSN": ["1432-1106"], "PISSN": ["0014-4819"], "DATABASE": ["MEDLINE"], "MESH": ["Adaptation, Physiological/physiology", "Adult", "Arm/physiology", "Biomechanical Phenomena", "Central Nervous System/physiology", "Feedback/physiology", "Female", "Functional Laterality/physiology", "Humans", "Learning/physiology", "Male", "Movement/physiology", "Muscle, Skeletal/physiology", "Neuropsychological Tests", "Physical Stimulation", "Psychomotor Performance/physiology", "Reaction Time/physiology", "Time Factors", "Time Perception/physiology"]}

We observed how many of the patients were able to be occupationally reintegrated after completion of phase-II rehabilitation. Workload capacity significantly increased from 1.2 W/kg upon entry to 1.5 W/kg (p < or = 0.05) upon completion of 4 weeks cardiac rehabilitation. Workload capacity remained consistently high at 6 months and 1 year (1.5 W/kg) and at 1.5 and 2 years (1.7 W/kg).

Significant cholesterol (p < or = 0.01) reductions persisted at 6 months (216 mg/dl) and 1 year (215 mg/dl). After 1.5 and 2 years, the total cholesterol was less than 14% and 17% below the mean of cholesterol at the beginning of the program. Similarly, LDL cholesterol was 185 mg/dl before entering the program, 146 mg/dl after 4 weeks, 151 mg/dl after 6 months and 149 mg/dl after 1 year. Triglyceride levels showed a significant reduction (p < or = 0.01) with levels 189 mg/dl before entering the program, 148 mg/dl after 4 weeks, 151 mg/dl after 6 months and 154 mg/dl after 1 year.

A study aimed at clarifying actual status of blood contact during midwifery procedures was performed. Observations in a delivery room were conducted to record blood contact events experienced by midwives from the time of episiotomy until 2 hour after expulsion of the placenta. All gloves used by midwives were collected and tested for holes. Blood contact was defined as any contact with blood of a parturition woman as recognized visually by an observer. During a one-month study period data was obtained from a total of 19 midwives (12 midwives and 7 student midwives) who assisted in 8 deliveries. All of the midwives wore gowns with long sleeves, gloves and caps but did not use eye protection or masks. None of the parturient women had Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Deliveries caused widespread blood exposure to the midwives throughout the complete course. Protection from most of this exposure was provided by the gowns and gloves. However, direct blood contacts occurred to the fingers, hands or forearms in several midwives. These events were caused by partly because the midwives unintentionally performed procedures without gloves and partly because blood penetrated the gown and soaked to the skin. Direct blood contacts to the foot in two midwives and to the mouth in one also occurred. The overall perforation rate for gloves examined was 4 out of 154 (2.6%). Two gloves were broken during washing sharp instruments contaminated with blood, one was torn when wearing, and the remaining one appeared to have had a hole prior to use.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"], "AUTHOR": ["Kurumatani, N", "Boku, C", "Matsukura, K", "Kitauchi, S", "Sakaguchi, R", "Kamiya, K", "Motoyama, M", "Kataoka, M", "Miyata, H", "Yoshioka, N"], "SOURCE": ["Nihon koshu eisei zasshi] Japanese journal of public health"], "VOLUME": ["42"], "ISSUE": ["5"], "PAGES": ["330-7"], "LANGUAGE": ["jpn"], "PUBLDATE": ["1995-05"], "PUBLYEAR": ["1995"], "PUBLCOUNTRY": ["Japan"], "PISSN": ["0546-1766"], "DATABASE": ["MEDLINE"], "MESH": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Blood", "Delivery Rooms", "Female", "Humans", "Infectious Disease Transmission, Patient-to-Professional/prevention & control", "Midwifery", "Occupational Exposure", "Pregnancy", "Protective Clothing"]}
