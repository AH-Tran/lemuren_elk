{"DBRECORDID": "M12910211", "TITLE": ["Léiomyosarcome de la veine cave inférieure."], "ABSTRACT": ["Leiomyosarcoma of the inferior vena cava is a rare tumor of mesenchymal origin most commonly found in women. Clinical signs are non-specific. Imagery with ultrasound, CT, or MRI may strongly suggest the diagnosis, but it can only be confirmed by histologic examination of tissue obtained pre or intra-operatively. The tumor is slow growing but nonetheless carries a bad prognosis; it may grow to a large size before directly invading adjacent structures. Systemic spread is a late occurrence. Radical surgical resection is the only treatment which offers any hope for prolonged survival. Standard vascular surgical techniques are usually sufficient. Progress in the techniques of hepatectomy and liver transplantation have allowed the experienced surgeon to undertake the removal of retrohepatic lesions once considered unresectable. High-lying lesions adjacent to the hepatic veins or with thrombus extending into the proximal vena cava may require extracorporeal circulation with or without profound hypothermic circulatory arrest. The efficacy of chemotherapy, whether pre-operative for inaccessible tumors or post-operative for incompletely resected or recurrent tumor, is poorly defined and very limited."], "AUTHOR": ["Marcheix, B", "Dambrin, C", "Muscari, F", "Joseph-Hein, K", "Guimbaud, R", "Otal, P"], "SOURCE": ["Journal de chirurgie"], "VOLUME": ["140"], "ISSUE": ["3"], "PAGES": ["140-8"], "LANGUAGE": ["fre"], "PUBLDATE": ["2003-06"], "PUBLYEAR": ["2003"], "PUBLCOUNTRY": ["France"], "EISSN": ["1773-0422"], "PISSN": ["0021-7697"], "DATABASE": ["MEDLINE"], "MESH": ["Aged", "Diagnosis, Differential", "Female", "Humans", "Leiomyosarcoma/diagnosis", "Leiomyosarcoma/diagnostic imaging", "Leiomyosarcoma/pathology", "Leiomyosarcoma/surgery", "Magnetic Resonance Imaging", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Prognosis", "Tomography, X-Ray Computed", "Ultrasonography", "Vascular Neoplasms/diagnosis", "Vascular Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging", "Vascular Neoplasms/pathology", "Vascular Neoplasms/surgery", "Vena Cava, Inferior/diagnostic imaging", "Vena Cava, Inferior/pathology", "Vena Cava, Inferior/surgery"]}

We report the first concerted application of DFT calculations of VCD, ECD, and OR to the determination of the AC of a natural product whose AC was previously undetermined. The natural product is the alkaloid schizozygine, isolated from Schizozygia caffaeoides. Comparison of DFT calculations of the VCD, ECD, and OR of schizozygine to experimental data leads, for each chiroptical technique, to the AC 2R,7S,20S,21S for the naturally occurring (+)-schizozygine. Three other alkaloids, schizogaline, schizogamine, and 6,7-dehydro-19beta-hydroxyschizozygine, have also been isolated from S. caffaeoides and shown to have structures closely related to schizozygine.

However, the effectiveness of informed consent in trauma patients is an under-researched area. This paper aims to assess the differences in patient recall of the consent process and desire for information by performing a comparative analysis between orthopaedic trauma and elective patients.!##!Methods!#!Information from 41 consecutive elective operations and 40 consecutive trauma operations was collected on the first post-operative day.!##!Results!#!100% of elective patients and 90% of trauma patients knew what operation they had received (p = 0.06). Overall recall of complications was poor, but was significantly lower in trauma patients compared with elective patients (62% vs 22%, p<0.001). 30% of trauma patients desired more information about their operation compared to 12% of elective patients (p = 0.049), although only 35% of trauma patients wanted written as well as verbal explanations, compared to 85% of elective patients p<0.001).

Patterning in the compound eye is fundamentally different: the boundary is not stable, but moves (the morphogenetic furrow). Paradoxically, Hedgehog signaling is essential to both: Hedgehog is expressed in the posterior compartments in the embryo and in imaginal discs, and posterior to the morphogenetic furrow in the eye. Therefore, uniquely in the eye, cells receiving a Hedgehog signal will eventually produce the same protein. We report that the mechanism that underlies this difference is the special regulation of hedgehog (hh) transcription through the dual regulation of an eye specific enhancer. We show that this enhancer requires the Egfr/Ras pathway transcription factor Pointed. Recently, others have shown that this same enhancer also requires the eye determining transcription factor Sine oculis (So).

When atom-atom interactions are present and when the mode functions overlap, the matter wave mode functions phi1 and phi2 develop components moving to the right and left, and this results in interference fringes in the density. At the many-body level, another source of interference arises from expectation values of the form (a(i)+a(j)) with i double dagger j, which become nonzero due to tunneling and interactions.

Three different forms of impairment of fore-hindlimb coordination depending on the extent of the lesions, were observed. Lesions sparing the dorsolateral or the ventral funiculus on one side preserved the equality of the fore- and hindlimb locomotor rhythms but changed the coupling between the movements of both girdles as compared to intact animals. Larger lesions in which, in addition to the ventral quadrants of the spinal cord, also major parts of the dorsolateral funiculi were destroyed elicited episodes of rhythm oscillations in both girdles, which appeared at the background of a small difference in these rhythms.

Polysulfate pentosan (PPS) decreases mesangial proliferation and extracellular matrix accumulation. The aim of this study was to determine whether PPS prevents glomerular hemodynamic changes and renal damage. Micropuncture studies were performed in three groups of eight male Wistar rats. Two groups included rats with 5/6 nephrectomy-one of which was treated with PPS in drinking water (100 mg/kg body wt) and the second of which received normal drinking water-and the third group consisted of normal rats that served as controls. Five/six nephrectomy produced systemic hypertension, a 50% reduction in GFR, and a 67% increase in single-nephron GFR due to elevated glomerular pressure and single-nephron plasma flow as well as proteinuria. Hypertension persisted in PPS-treated animals. Despite a similar reduction in GFR, PPS prevented the rise in single-nephron GFR, glomerular capillary hydrostatic pressure, and proteinuria. By morphometry, glomerular volume was increased by 46% and mesangial area by 94%. Fractional glomerular capillary area decreased by 24%. PPS prevented these changes. Tubular dilatation, epithelial cell atrophy, and increased interstitial area were largely prevented by PPS, as was the interstitial inflammatory infiltrate. These results suggest that the renal protection conferred by PPS was mediated both by prevention of glomerular hypertension as well as suppression of the inflammatory response. It was postulated that this was partly due to the preservation of a greater fraction of functional nephrons."], "AUTHOR": ["Bobadilla, N A", "Tack, I", "Tapia, E", "Sánchez-Lozada, L G", "Santamaría, J", "Jiménez, F", "Striker, L J", "Striker, G E", "Herrera-Acosta, J"], "SOURCE": ["Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN"], "VOLUME": ["12"], "ISSUE": ["10"], "PAGES": ["2080-7"], "LANGUAGE": ["eng"], "PUBLDATE": ["2001-10"], "PUBLYEAR": ["2001"], "PUBLCOUNTRY": ["United States"], "EISSN": ["1533-3450"], "PISSN": ["1046-6673"], "DATABASE": ["MEDLINE"], "MESH": ["Animals", "Anticoagulants/pharmacology", "Blood Pressure", "Hemodynamics/drug effects", "Hypertension/etiology", "Hypertension/pathology", "Hypertension/physiopathology", "Hypertension/prevention & control", "Kidney/pathology", "Kidney Glomerulus/drug effects", "Kidney Glomerulus/pathology", "Male", "Nephrectomy/methods", "Pentosan Sulfuric Polyester/pharmacology", "Proteinuria/urine", "Rats", "Rats, Wistar"], "CHEM": ["Anticoagulants", "Pentosan Sulfuric Polyester (37300-21-3)"]}

ICHs were classified as hyperacute, acute, early subacute, late subacute, or chronic. Patients underwent 1.5- and 3.0-T MR imaging with T2-weighted fast spin-echo, fluid-attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR), and T1-weighted spin-echo (1.5-T) and gradient-echo (3.0-T) sequences within 4 hours of each other. The central (ie, core) and peripheral (ie, body) parts of the ICHs were analyzed quantitatively by using contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) calculations derived from signal intensity (SI) measurements; these values were statistically evaluated by using the Mann-Whitney U test. Two readers qualitatively determined SIs of the cores and bodies of the ICHs, degrees of apparent susceptibility artifacts, and lesion ages. The chi(2) test was used to determine statistically significant differences.!##!Results!#!With the exception of the bodies of late subacute ICHs at 3.0-T T2-weighted imaging, which had increased positive CNRs and SI scores (P </=.05), all parts of the ICHs at all stages showed increased negative CNRs and SI scores at 3.0-T FLAIR and T2-weighted imaging, as compared with these values at 1.5 T (P </=.05). No significant CNR or SI score differences at any ICH stage were observed between 1.5-T spin-echo and 3.0-T gradient-echo T1-weighted imaging (P >.05). With the exception of minor susceptibility artifacts seen in acute and early subacute ICHs at 3.0-T T1-weighted gradient-echo imaging, no susceptibility artifacts were noticed. The ages of most lesions were identified correctly without significant differences between the two field strengths (P >.05), with the exception of the ages of acute ICHs, which were occasionally misinterpreted as early subacute lesions at 3.0 T.!##!Conclusion!#!At 3.0 T, all parts of acute and early subacute ICHs had significantly increased hypointensity on FLAIR and T2-weighted MR images as compared with the SIs of these lesions at 1.5 T.

{"DBRECORDID": "M16051198", "TITLE": ["Melatonin decreases calcium levels in retinotectal axons of Xenopus laevis by indirect activation of group III metabotropic glutamate receptors."], "ABSTRACT": ["Melatonin is a neuromodulator that binds to receptors in the retinotectal laminae of the amphibian optic tectum. The effect of melatonin on calcium dynamics in Xenopus retinotectal axons was investigated by imaging retinotectal axons labeled with the fluorescent indicator Fluo-4. Melatonin exerted an inhibitory influence on depolarization-evoked calcium increases, and the melatonin receptor antagonist 4-P-PDOT blocked this effect. Blockade of group III metabotropic receptors (mGluRs) counteracted the effect of melatonin on retinotectal axons. Application of the group II/group III mGluR antagonist MSPG or the group III-selective antagonist MSOP abolished the effect of melatonin. Conversely, this effect was not significantly affected by the group I mGluR antagonist LY367385 nor by EGLU or LY341495 at concentrations that specifically inhibit group II mGluRs. Furthermore, a higher concentration of LY341495 that affects group III mGluRs inhibited the effect of melatonin. The data therefore support the hypothesis that, in retinotectal axons, melatonin reduces cAMP levels, thereby relieving PKA-induced inhibition of group III mGluRs; the newly activated mGluRs in turn inhibit voltage-sensitive calcium channels, leading to a decrease in Ca2+ concentrations. The role of GABA(C) receptors in retinotectal responses was also evaluated. GABA(C) receptor antagonists did not block the effects of melatonin but instead were additive. Moreover, while other studies have shown that in Xenopus tectal cells, GABA(C) receptors mediate inhibition, in retinotectal axons, the opposite appears to occur since depolarization-evoked calcium rises in retinotectal axons were inhibited by GABA(C) receptor blockade. This result suggests that activation of GABA(C) receptors produces an increase in the synaptic excitability of retinotectal axon terminals."], "AUTHOR": ["Prada, Claudia", "Udin, Susan B"], "SOURCE": ["Brain research"], "VOLUME": ["1053"], "ISSUE": ["1-2"], "PAGES": ["67-76"], "LANGUAGE": ["eng"], "PUBLDATE": ["2005-08-16"], "PUBLYEAR": ["2005"], "PUBLCOUNTRY": ["Netherlands"], "DOI": ["10.1016/j.brainres.2005.06.029"], "EISSN": ["1872-6240"], "PISSN": ["0006-8993"], "DATABASE": ["MEDLINE"], "MESH": ["Aniline Compounds/metabolism", "Animals", "Antioxidants/pharmacology", "Axons/drug effects", "Axons/metabolism", "Calcium/metabolism", "Diagnostic Imaging/methods", "Dose-Response Relationship, Drug", "Drug Interactions", "Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists/pharmacology", "GABA Antagonists/pharmacology", "In Vitro Techniques", "Melatonin/analogs & derivatives", "Melatonin/antagonists & inhibitors", "Melatonin/pharmacology", "Models, Neurological", "Phosphinic Acids/pharmacology", "Picrotoxin/pharmacology", "Potassium Chloride/pharmacology", "Pyridines/pharmacology", "Receptors, Metabotropic Glutamate/physiology", "Retinal Ganglion Cells/drug effects", "Superior Colliculi/cytology", "Superior Colliculi/drug effects", "Tetrahydronaphthalenes/pharmacology", "Xanthenes/metabolism", "Xenopus laevis"], "CHEM": ["(1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridin-4-yl)methylphosphinic acid", "4-phenyl-2-propionamidotetraline", "Aniline Compounds", "Antioxidants", "Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists", "Fluo 4", "GABA Antagonists", "Phosphinic Acids", "Pyridines", "Receptors, Metabotropic Glutamate", "Tetrahydronaphthalenes", "Xanthenes", "metabotropic glutamate receptor 3", "Picrotoxin (124-87-8)", "6-chloromelatonin (63762-74-3)", "Potassium Chloride (660YQ98I10)", "Melatonin (JL5DK93RCL)", "Calcium (SY7Q814VUP)"]}

Almost all of these early recurrences are due to recrudescence rather than reinfection by a new strain. After the first year, the recurrence rates approximate to the rate of natural acquisition of H. pylori infection. By contrast, in developing countries, higher rates of recurrence suggest a major role of real reinfection. Important predictive factors of H. pylori treatment success are compliance and bacterial susceptibility to antibiotics. The new 1-week triple therapies, based on a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and 2 antibiotics, lead to treatment discontinuation but rarely. If containing a nitroimidazole, their efficacy is reduced to 60 to 80% by pretreatment in vitro resistance. The prevalence of nitroimidazole resistance varies dependent on the geographical area, with rates over 50% in tropical regions. Resistance against macrolides hinders treatment success in 50 to 80% of patients. In the US, south-western Europe and Japan the prevalence of macrolide resistance amounts to about 10%, in other countries about 3%. After failed treatment, acquired resistance is frequent. Testing for resistance is recommended to facilitate the decision for an alternative triple therapy or for quadruple therapy comprising bismuth, metronidazole, tetracycline and a PPI. It seems reasonable to increase the dose of PPI in a retreatment regimen containing amoxicillin. Post-treatment double resistance against nitroimidazoles and macrolides reduces the success of most of the currently evaluated retreatment regimens. To overcome double resistance, high dose PPI plus amoxicillin is one approach, beside other experimental multidrug treatments."], "AUTHOR": ["Peitz, U", "Hackelsberger, A", "Malfertheiner, P"], "SOURCE": ["Drugs"], "VOLUME": ["57"], "ISSUE": ["6"], "PAGES": ["905-20"], "LANGUAGE": ["eng"], "PUBLDATE": ["1999-06"], "PUBLYEAR": ["1999"], "PUBLCOUNTRY": ["New Zealand"], "DOI": ["10.2165/00003495-199957060-00006"], "EISSN": ["1179-1950"], "PISSN": ["0012-6667"], "DATABASE": ["MEDLINE"], "MESH": ["Drug Resistance, Microbial/immunology", "Helicobacter Infections/therapy", "Helicobacter pylori", "Humans", "Secondary Prevention", "Treatment Failure"]}

Fischer's ratio (indicating the balance of plasma amino acids) was also examined as an index of the nutritional status. It was significantly lower in secondary infection compared with primary infection. Moreover, secondary infection was associated with a lower positive rate for the DNCB skin reaction and a lower Fischer's ratio when compared with pulmonary tuberculosis. Thus impairment of cell-mediated immunity, malnutrition, and a poor prognosis were significantly more common in secondary infection compared with primary infection."], "AUTHOR": ["Tomoda, K", "Yoneda, T", "Tsukaguchi, K", "Yoshikawa, M", "Tokuyama, T", "Fu, A", "Narita, N"], "SOURCE": ["Kekkaku : [Tuberculosis"], "VOLUME": ["68"], "ISSUE": ["9"], "PAGES": ["559-64"], "LANGUAGE": ["jpn"], "PUBLDATE": ["1993-09"], "PUBLYEAR": ["1993"], "PUBLCOUNTRY": ["Japan"], "EISSN": ["1884-2410"], "PISSN": ["0022-9776"], "DATABASE": ["MEDLINE"], "MESH": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Aged", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Mycobacterium Infections, Nontuberculous/immunology", "Mycobacterium Infections, Nontuberculous/physiopathology", "Tuberculosis, Pulmonary/immunology", "Tuberculosis, Pulmonary/physiopathology"]}

Adrenaline pretreatment did not change the activity of the Na+/Ca2+-antiporter of isolated heart mitochondria. Simultaneous measurements of the membrane potential revealed that perfusion with adrenaline has no significant effect on this parameter during Ca2+ accumulation. The activation of Ca2+ uptake was induced also by the alpha-adrenergic agonist, methoxamine, but not by the beta-adrenergic agonist, isoprenaline. Methoxamine pretreatment also increased the sensitivity of alpha-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase in intact mitochondria to 10 nM--300 nM extramitochondrial Ca2+ during steady-state Ca2+ recycling across the inner membrane. Possible implications of these data for the adrenergic regulation of oxidative metabolism are discussed."], "AUTHOR": ["Kessar, P", "Crompton, M"], "SOURCE": ["The Biochemical journal"], "VOLUME": ["200"], "ISSUE": ["2"], "PAGES": ["379-88"], "LANGUAGE": ["eng"], "PUBLDATE": ["1981-11-15"], "PUBLYEAR": ["1981"], "PUBLCOUNTRY": ["England"], "DOI": ["10.1042/bj2000379"], "EISSN": ["1470-8728"], "PISSN": ["0264-6021", "0006-2936", "0306-3275"], "DATABASE": ["MEDLINE"], "MESH": ["Animals", "Biological Transport/drug effects", "Calcium/metabolism", "Epinephrine/pharmacology", "In Vitro Techniques", "Isoproterenol/pharmacology", "Membrane Potentials/drug effects", "Methoxamine/pharmacology", "Mitochondria, Heart/drug effects", "Mitochondria, Heart/metabolism", "Perfusion", "Rats", "Rats, Inbred Strains", "Sodium/metabolism"], "CHEM": ["Sodium (9NEZ333N27)", "Methoxamine (HUQ1KC1YLI)", "Isoproterenol (L628TT009W)", "Calcium (SY7Q814VUP)", "Epinephrine (YKH834O4BH)"]}

The administration of vaccines and/or the pretreatment against possible nerve agent poisoning, pyridostigmine bromide (PB), given to armed forces personnel during the Gulf Conflict has been implicated as a possible factor in the aetiology of these illnesses. The possibility that long-term health effects may result from the administration of these vaccines (anthrax, pertussis, plague, yellow fever, polio, typhoid, tetanus, hepatitis B, meningococcal meningitis and cholera) and/or PB, have been investigated using a non-human primate model, the common marmoset. This paper reports the results from three aspects of the study, cognitive behaviour (performance of a touchscreen mediated discrimination task), muscle function (performance of a simple strength test) and general health. There were no marked long-term changes in cognition, muscle function or health that could be attributed to vaccines and/or PB administration. Statistical differences related to treatments were only observed in two aspects of cognition and one of clinical chemistry. These changes were transient in nature and their magnitude were minor and, in consequence, was not regarded as having long-term biological significance."], "AUTHOR": ["Stevens, D", "Scott, E A M", "Bowditch, A P", "Griffiths, G D", "Pearce, P C"], "SOURCE": ["Pharmacology, biochemistry, and behavior"], "VOLUME": ["84"], "ISSUE": ["2"], "PAGES": ["207-18"], "LANGUAGE": ["eng"], "PUBLDATE": ["2006-06"], "PUBLYEAR": ["2006"], "PUBLCOUNTRY": ["United States"], "DOI": ["10.1016/j.pbb.2006.04.020"], "EISSN": ["1873-5177"], "PISSN": ["0091-3057"], "DATABASE": ["MEDLINE"], "MESH": ["Acetylcholinesterase/blood", "Alanine Transaminase/blood", "Alkaline Phosphatase/blood", "Animals", "Body Weight/drug effects", "Callithrix", "Cognition/drug effects", "Creatinine/blood", "Discrimination (Psychology)/drug effects", "Female", "Isocitrate Dehydrogenase/blood", "Male", "Muscle Weakness/etiology", "Muscles/drug effects", "Muscles/physiology", "Persian Gulf Syndrome/etiology", "Pyridostigmine Bromide/pharmacology", "Urea/blood", "Vaccines/pharmacology"], "CHEM": ["Vaccines", "Urea (8W8T17847W)", "Creatinine (AYI8EX34EU)", "Isocitrate Dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.41)", "Alanine Transaminase (EC 2.6.1.2)", "Acetylcholinesterase (EC 3.1.1.7)", "Alkaline Phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.1)", "Pyridostigmine Bromide (KVI301NA53)"]}
